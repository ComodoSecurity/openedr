# 5.	General/Miscellaneous

5.1	Entire Agreement.  This agreement, along with any attached schedules and any documents referred to herein, is the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter, superseding all other agreements that may exist with respect to the subject matter.  Section headings are for reference and convenience only and are not part of the interpretation of the agreement.

5.2		Waiver.  A party’s failure to enforce a provision of this agreement does not waive the party’s right to enforce the same provision later or right to enforce any other provision of this agreement.  To be effective, all waivers must be both in writing and signed by the party benefiting from the waived provision.

5.3	Arbitration and Governing Law.  ARBITRATION MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JUDGE OR JURY TRIAL IN A COURT PROCEEDING AND YOUR GROUNDS FOR APPEAL ARE LIMITED

You agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of this agreement shall be determined by binding arbitration. Before you may begin arbitration with respect to a dispute involving any aspect of this Agreement, you shall notify Comodo and any other party to the dispute for the purpose of seeking dispute resolution. The notice to Comodo should be addressed to 1255 Broad Street, Clifton, New Jersey 07013.

If the dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days after the initial notice, then a
party may proceed in accordance with the following: Any unresolved dispute arising under the terms of this Agreement shall be decided by arbitration conducted through the services of the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (hereinafter referred to as the “AAA”). Notice of demand for an arbitration hearing shall be in writing and properly served upon the parties to this Agreement. Arbitration hearings shall be held in the state of New Jersey at a location mutually agreeable to the parties.

The laws of the state of New Jersey govern the interpretation, construction and enforcement of this agreement and all proceedings arising out of it without regard to any conflicts of laws principles.  Both parties agree to the exclusive venue and jurisdiction of state or U.S. federal courts located in New Jersey.

The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act shall not apply to this agreement and are specifically excluded.

Any proceedings to resolve or litigate any dispute in any forum will be conducted solely on an individual basis. Neither you nor Comodo will seek to have any dispute heard as a class action, private attorney general action, or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity. No arbitration or proceeding will be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected arbitration or proceedings.

5.4	Assignment. You may not assign any of your rights or obligations under this agreement, whether by merger, consolidation, operation of law, or any other manner, without the prior written consent of Comodo.  For purposes of this section only, a change in control is deemed an assignment.  Any transfer without consent is void.  To the extent allowed by law, Comodo may assign its rights and obligations without your consent.

5.5	Severability.  In the event that any provision is held invalid, unconscionable, or unenforceable in any manner, the licenses under this Agreement automatically terminate.
