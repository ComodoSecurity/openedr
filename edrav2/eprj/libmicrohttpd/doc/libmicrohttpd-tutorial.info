1 Introduction
**************

This tutorial is for developers who want to learn how they can add HTTP
serving capabilities to their applications with the _GNU libmicrohttpd_
library, abbreviated _MHD_. The reader will learn how to implement basic
HTTP functions from simple executable sample programs that implement
various features.

   The text is supposed to be a supplement to the API reference manual
of _GNU libmicrohttpd_ and for that reason does not explain many of the
parameters.  Therefore, the reader should always consult the manual to
find the exact meaning of the functions used in the tutorial.
Furthermore, the reader is encouraged to study the relevant _RFCs_,
which document the HTTP standard.

   _GNU libmicrohttpd_ is assumed to be already installed.  This
tutorial is written for version 0.9.48.  At the time being, this
tutorial has only been tested on _GNU/Linux_ machines even though
efforts were made not to rely on anything that would prevent the samples
from being built on similar systems.

1.1 History
===========

This tutorial was originally written by Sebastian Gerhardt for MHD
0.4.0.  It was slighly polished and updated to MHD 0.9.0 by Christian
Grothoff.

2 Hello browser example
***********************

The most basic task for a HTTP server is to deliver a static text
message to any client connecting to it.  Given that this is also easy to
implement, it is an excellent problem to start with.

   For now, the particular URI the client asks for shall have no effect
on the message that will be returned.  In addition, the server shall end
the connection after the message has been sent so that the client will
know there is nothing more to expect.

   The C program 'hellobrowser.c', which is to be found in the examples
section, does just that.  If you are very eager, you can compile and
start it right away but it is advisable to type the lines in by yourself
as they will be discussed and explained in detail.

   After the necessary includes and the definition of the port which our
server should listen on
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/select.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <microhttpd.h>

#define PORT 8888


the desired behaviour of our server when HTTP request arrive has to be
implemented.  We already have agreed that it should not care about the
particular details of the request, such as who is requesting what.  The
server will respond merely with the same small HTML page to every
request.

   The function we are going to write now will be called by _GNU
libmicrohttpd_ every time an appropriate request comes in.  While the
name of this callback function is arbitrary, its parameter list has to
follow a certain layout.  So please, ignore the lot of parameters for
now, they will be explained at the point they are needed.  We have to
use only one of them, 'struct MHD_Connection *connection', for the
minimalistic functionality we want to achieve at the moment.

   This parameter is set by the _libmicrohttpd_ daemon and holds the
necessary information to relate the call with a certain connection.
Keep in mind that a server might have to satisfy hundreds of concurrent
connections and we have to make sure that the correct data is sent to
the destined client.  Therefore, this variable is a means to refer to a
particular connection if we ask the daemon to sent the reply.

   Talking about the reply, it is defined as a string right after the
function header
int answer_to_connection (void *cls, struct MHD_Connection *connection,
                          const char *url,
                          const char *method, const char *version,
                          const char *upload_data,
                          size_t *upload_data_size, void **con_cls)
{
  const char *page  = "<html><body>Hello, browser!</body></html>";


HTTP is a rather strict protocol and the client would certainly consider
it "inappropriate" if we just sent the answer string "as is".  Instead,
it has to be wrapped with additional information stored in so-called
headers and footers.  Most of the work in this area is done by the
library for us--we just have to ask.  Our reply string packed in the
necessary layers will be called a "response".  To obtain such a response
we hand our data (the reply-string) and its size over to the
'MHD_create_response_from_buffer' function.  The last two parameters
basically tell _MHD_ that we do not want it to dispose the message data
for us when it has been sent and there also needs no internal copy to be
done because the _constant_ string won't change anyway.

  struct MHD_Response *response;
  int ret;

  response = MHD_create_response_from_buffer (strlen (page),
                                            (void*) page, MHD_RESPMEM_PERSISTENT);


Now that the the response has been laced up, it is ready for delivery
and can be queued for sending.  This is done by passing it to another
_GNU libmicrohttpd_ function.  As all our work was done in the scope of
one function, the recipient is without doubt the one associated with the
local variable 'connection' and consequently this variable is given to
the queue function.  Every HTTP response is accompanied by a status
code, here "OK", so that the client knows this response is the intended
result of his request and not due to some error or malfunction.

   Finally, the packet is destroyed and the return value from the queue
returned, already being set at this point to either MHD_YES or MHD_NO in
case of success or failure.

  ret = MHD_queue_response (connection, MHD_HTTP_OK, response);
  MHD_destroy_response (response);

  return ret;
}


With the primary task of our server implemented, we can start the actual
server daemon which will listen on 'PORT' for connections.  This is done
in the main function.
int main ()
{
  struct MHD_Daemon *daemon;

  daemon = MHD_start_daemon (MHD_USE_INTERNAL_POLLING_THREAD, PORT, NULL, NULL,
                             &answer_to_connection, NULL, MHD_OPTION_END);
  if (NULL == daemon) return 1;


The first parameter is one of three possible modes of operation.  Here
we want the daemon to run in a separate thread and to manage all
incoming connections in the same thread.  This means that while
producing the response for one connection, the other connections will be
put on hold.  In this example, where the reply is already known and
therefore the request is served quickly, this poses no problem.

   We will allow all clients to connect regardless of their name or
location, therefore we do not check them on connection and set the third
and fourth parameter to NULL.

   Parameter five is the address of the function we want to be called
whenever a new connection has been established.  Our
'answer_to_connection' knows best what the client wants and needs no
additional information (which could be passed via the next parameter) so
the next (sixth) parameter is NULL. Likewise, we do not need to pass
extra options to the daemon so we just write the MHD_OPTION_END as the
last parameter.

   As the server daemon runs in the background in its own thread, the
execution flow in our main function will contine right after the call.
Because of this, we must delay the execution flow in the main thread or
else the program will terminate prematurely.  We let it pause in a
processing-time friendly manner by waiting for the enter key to be
pressed.  In the end, we stop the daemon so it can do its cleanup tasks.
  getchar ();

  MHD_stop_daemon (daemon);
  return 0;
}


The first example is now complete.

   Compile it with
cc hellobrowser.c -o hellobrowser -I$PATH_TO_LIBMHD_INCLUDES
  -L$PATH_TO_LIBMHD_LIBS -lmicrohttpd
   with the two paths set accordingly and run it.

   Now open your favorite Internet browser and go to the address
'http://localhost:8888/', provided that 8888 is the port you chose.  If
everything works as expected, the browser will present the message of
the static HTML page it got from our minimal server.

Remarks
=======

To keep this first example as small as possible, some drastic shortcuts
were taken and are to be discussed now.

   Firstly, there is no distinction made between the kinds of requests a
client could send.  We implied that the client sends a GET request, that
means, that he actually asked for some data.  Even when it is not
intended to accept POST requests, a good server should at least
recognize that this request does not constitute a legal request and
answer with an error code.  This can be easily implemented by checking
if the parameter 'method' equals the string "GET" and returning a
'MHD_NO' if not so.

   Secondly, the above practice of queuing a response upon the first
call of the callback function brings with it some limitations.  This is
because the content of the message body will not be received if a
response is queued in the first iteration.  Furthermore, the connection
will be closed right after the response has been transferred then.  This
is typically not what you want as it disables HTTP pipelining.  The
correct approach is to simply not queue a message on the first callback
unless there is an error.  The 'void**' argument to the callback
provides a location for storing information about the history of the
connection; for the first call, the pointer will point to NULL. A
simplistic way to differenciate the first call from others is to check
if the pointer is NULL and set it to a non-NULL value during the first
call.

   Both of these issues you will find addressed in the official
'minimal_example.c' residing in the 'src/examples' directory of the
_MHD_ package.  The source code of this program should look very
familiar to you by now and easy to understand.

   For our example, we create the response from a static (persistent)
buffer in memory and thus pass 'MHD_RESPMEM_PERSISTENT' to the response
construction function.  In the usual case, responses are not transmitted
immediately after being queued.  For example, there might be other data
on the system that needs to be sent with a higher priority.
Nevertheless, the queue function will return successfully--raising the
problem that the data we have pointed to may be invalid by the time it
is about being sent.  This is not an issue here because we can expect
the 'page' string, which is a constant _string literal_ here, to be
static.  That means it will be present and unchanged for as long as the
program runs.  For dynamic data, one could choose to either have _MHD_
free the memory 'page' points to itself when it is not longer needed (by
passing 'MHD_RESPMEM_MUST_FREE') or, alternatively, have the library to
make and manage its own copy of it (by passing 'MHD_RESPMEM_MUST_COPY').
Naturally, this last option is the most expensive.

Exercises
=========

   * While the server is running, use a program like 'telnet' or
     'netcat' to connect to it.  Try to form a valid HTTP 1.1 request
     yourself like
     GET /dontcare HTTP/1.1
     Host: itsme
     <enter>
     and see what the server returns to you.

   * Also, try other requests, like POST, and see how our server does
     not mind and why.  How far in malforming a request can you go
     before the builtin functionality of _MHD_ intervenes and an altered
     response is sent?  Make sure you read about the status codes in the
     _RFC_.

   * Add the option 'MHD_USE_PEDANTIC_CHECKS' to the start function of
     the daemon in 'main'.  Mind the special format of the parameter
     list here which is described in the manual.  How indulgent is the
     server now to your input?

   * Let the main function take a string as the first command line
     argument and pass 'argv[1]' to the 'MHD_start_daemon' function as
     the sixth parameter.  The address of this string will be passed to
     the callback function via the 'cls' variable.  Decorate the text
     given at the command line when the server is started with proper
     HTML tags and send it as the response instead of the former static
     string.

   * _Demanding:_ Write a separate function returning a string
     containing some useful information, for example, the time.  Pass
     the function's address as the sixth parameter and evaluate this
     function on every request anew in 'answer_to_connection'.  Remember
     to free the memory of the string every time after satisfying the
     request.

3 Exploring requests
********************

This chapter will deal with the information which the client sends to
the server at every request.  We are going to examine the most useful
fields of such an request and print them out in a readable manner.  This
could be useful for logging facilities.

   The starting point is the _hellobrowser_ program with the former
response removed.

   This time, we just want to collect information in the callback
function, thus we will just return MHD_NO after we have probed the
request.  This way, the connection is closed without much ado by the
server.

static int 
answer_to_connection (void *cls, struct MHD_Connection *connection, 
                      const char *url, 
		      const char *method, const char *version, 
		      const char *upload_data, 
                      size_t *upload_data_size, void **con_cls)
{
  ...  
  return MHD_NO;
}
The ellipsis marks the position where the following instructions shall
be inserted.

   We begin with the most obvious information available to the server,
the request line.  You should already have noted that a request consists
of a command (or "HTTP method") and a URI (e.g.  a filename).  It also
contains a string for the version of the protocol which can be found in
'version'.  To call it a "new request" is justified because we return
only 'MHD_NO', thus ensuring the function will not be called again for
this connection.
printf ("New %s request for %s using version %s\n", method, url, version);

   The rest of the information is a bit more hidden.  Nevertheless,
there is lot of it sent from common Internet browsers.  It is stored in
"key-value" pairs and we want to list what we find in the header.  As
there is no mandatory set of keys a client has to send, each key-value
pair is printed out one by one until there are no more left.  We do this
by writing a separate function which will be called for each pair just
like the above function is called for each HTTP request.  It can then
print out the content of this pair.
int print_out_key (void *cls, enum MHD_ValueKind kind, 
                   const char *key, const char *value)
{
  printf ("%s: %s\n", key, value);
  return MHD_YES;
}

   To start the iteration process that calls our new function for every
key, the line
MHD_get_connection_values (connection, MHD_HEADER_KIND, &print_out_key, NULL);
needs to be inserted in the connection callback function too.  The
second parameter tells the function that we are only interested in keys
from the general HTTP header of the request.  Our iterating function
'print_out_key' does not rely on any additional information to fulfill
its duties so the last parameter can be NULL.

   All in all, this constitutes the complete 'logging.c' program for
this chapter which can be found in the 'examples' section.

   Connecting with any modern Internet browser should yield a handful of
keys.  You should try to interpret them with the aid of _RFC 2616_.
Especially worth mentioning is the "Host" key which is often used to
serve several different websites hosted under one single IP address but
reachable by different domain names (this is called virtual hosting).

Conclusion
==========

The introduced capabilities to itemize the content of a simple GET
request--especially the URI--should already allow the server to satisfy
clients' requests for small specific resources (e.g.  files) or even
induce alteration of server state.  However, the latter is not
recommended as the GET method (including its header data) is by
convention considered a "safe" operation, which should not change the
server's state in a significant way.  By convention, GET operations can
thus be performed by crawlers and other automatic software.  Naturally
actions like searching for a passed string are fine.

   Of course, no transmission can occur while the return value is still
set to 'MHD_NO' in the callback function.

Exercises
=========

   * By parsing the 'url' string and delivering responses accordingly,
     implement a small server for "virtual" files.  When asked for
     '/index.htm{l}', let the response consist of a HTML page containing
     a link to '/another.html' page which is also to be created "on the
     fly" in case of being requested.  If neither of these two pages are
     requested, 'MHD_HTTP_NOT_FOUND' shall be returned accompanied by an
     informative message.

   * A very interesting information has still been ignored by our
     logger--the client's IP address.  Implement a callback function
     static int on_client_connect (void *cls,
                                   const struct sockaddr *addr,
     			      socklen_t addrlen)
     that prints out the IP address in an appropriate format.  You might
     want to use the POSIX function 'inet_ntoa' but bear in mind that
     'addr' is actually just a structure containing other substructures
     and is _not_ the variable this function expects.  Make sure to
     return 'MHD_YES' so that the library knows the client is allowed to
     connect (and to then process the request).  If one wanted to limit
     access basing on IP addresses, this would be the place to do it.
     The address of your 'on_client_connect' function must be passed as
     the third parameter to the 'MHD_start_daemon' call.

4 Response headers
******************

Now that we are able to inspect the incoming request in great detail,
this chapter discusses the means to enrich the outgoing responses
likewise.

   As you have learned in the _Hello, Browser_ chapter, some obligatory
header fields are added and set automatically for simple responses by
the library itself but if more advanced features are desired, additional
fields have to be created.  One of the possible fields is the content
type field and an example will be developed around it.  This will lead
to an application capable of correctly serving different types of files.

   When we responded with HTML page packed in the static string
previously, the client had no choice but guessing about how to handle
the response, because the server had not told him.  What if we had sent
a picture or a sound file?  Would the message have been understood or
merely been displayed as an endless stream of random characters in the
browser?  This is what the mime content types are for.  The header of
the response is extended by certain information about how the data is to
be interpreted.

   To introduce the concept, a picture of the format _PNG_ will be sent
to the client and labeled accordingly with 'image/png'.  Once again, we
can base the new example on the 'hellobrowser' program.

#define FILENAME "picture.png"
#define MIMETYPE "image/png"

static int 
answer_to_connection (void *cls, struct MHD_Connection *connection, 
		      const char *url, 
                      const char *method, const char *version, 
		      const char *upload_data, 
              	      size_t *upload_data_size, void **con_cls)
{
  unsigned char *buffer = NULL;
  struct MHD_Response *response;

   We want the program to open the file for reading and determine its
size:
  int fd;
  int ret;
  struct stat sbuf;

  if (0 != strcmp (method, "GET"))
    return MHD_NO;
  if ( (-1 == (fd = open (FILENAME, O_RDONLY))) ||
       (0 != fstat (fd, &sbuf)) )
    {
     /* error accessing file */
      /* ... (see below) */
    }
 /* ... (see below) */

   When dealing with files, there is a lot that could go wrong on the
server side and if so, the client should be informed with
'MHD_HTTP_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR'.

      /* error accessing file */
     if (fd != -1) close (fd);
      const char *errorstr =
        "<html><body>An internal server error has occured!\
                              </body></html>";
      response =
	MHD_create_response_from_buffer (strlen (errorstr), 
				         (void *) errorstr, 
				         MHD_RESPMEM_PERSISTENT);
      if (response)
        {
          ret =
            MHD_queue_response (connection, MHD_HTTP_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR,
                                response);
          MHD_destroy_response (response);

          return MHD_YES;
        }
      else
        return MHD_NO;
  if (!ret) 
    {
      const char *errorstr = "<html><body>An internal server error has occured!\
                              </body></html>";

      if (buffer) free(buffer);
    
      response = MHD_create_response_from_buffer (strlen(errorstr), (void*) errorstr,
                                                  MHD_RESPMEM_PERSISTENT);

      if (response)
        {     
          ret = MHD_queue_response (connection, 
	      			    MHD_HTTP_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR, 
				    response);
          MHD_destroy_response (response);

          return MHD_YES;    
        } 
      else return MHD_NO;
    }

   Note that we nevertheless have to create a response object even for
sending a simple error code.  Otherwise, the connection would just be
closed without comment, leaving the client curious about what has
happened.

   But in the case of success a response will be constructed directly
from the file descriptor:

     /* error accessing file */
     /* ... (see above) */
    }

  response =
    MHD_create_response_from_fd_at_offset (sbuf.st_size, fd, 0);
  MHD_add_response_header (response, "Content-Type", MIMETYPE);
  ret = MHD_queue_response (connection, MHD_HTTP_OK, response);
  MHD_destroy_response (response);

   Note that the response object will take care of closing the file
desciptor for us.

   Up to this point, there was little new.  The actual novelty is that
we enhance the header with the meta data about the content.  Aware of
the field's name we want to add, it is as easy as that:
MHD_add_response_header(response, "Content-Type", MIMETYPE);
We do not have to append a colon expected by the protocol behind the
first field--_GNU libhttpdmicro_ will take care of this.

   The function finishes with the well-known lines
  ret = MHD_queue_response (connection, MHD_HTTP_OK, response);
  MHD_destroy_response (response);
  return ret;
}

   The complete program 'responseheaders.c' is in the 'examples' section
as usual.  Find a _PNG_ file you like and save it to the directory the
example is run from under the name 'picture.png'.  You should find the
image displayed on your browser if everything worked well.

Remarks
=======

The include file of the _MHD_ library comes with the header types
mentioned in _RFC 2616_ already defined as macros.  Thus, we could have
written 'MHD_HTTP_HEADER_CONTENT_TYPE' instead of '"Content-Type"' as
well.  However, one is not limited to these standard headers and could
add custom response headers without violating the protocol.  Whether,
and how, the client would react to these custom header is up to the
receiver.  Likewise, the client is allowed to send custom request
headers to the server as well, opening up yet more possibilities how
client and server could communicate with each other.

   The method of creating the response from a file on disk only works
for static content.  Serving dynamically created responses will be a
topic of a future chapter.

Exercises
=========

   * Remember that the original program was written under a few
     assumptions--a static response using a local file being one of
     them.  In order to simulate a very large or hard to reach file that
     cannot be provided instantly, postpone the queuing in the callback
     with the 'sleep' function for 30 seconds _if_ the file '/big.png'
     is requested (but deliver the same as above).  A request for
     '/picture.png' should provide just the same but without any
     artificial delays.

     Now start two instances of your browser (or even use two machines)
     and see how the second client is put on hold while the first waits
     for his request on the slow file to be fulfilled.

     Finally, change the sourcecode to use
     'MHD_USE_THREAD_PER_CONNECTION' when the daemon is started and try
     again.

   * Did you succeed in implementing the clock exercise yet?  This time,
     let the server save the program's start time 't' and implement a
     response simulating a countdown that reaches 0 at 't+60'.
     Returning a message saying on which point the countdown is, the
     response should ultimately be to reply "Done" if the program has
     been running long enough,

     An unofficial, but widely understood, response header line is
     'Refresh: DELAY; url=URL' with the uppercase words substituted to
     tell the client it should request the given resource after the
     given delay again.  Improve your program in that the browser (any
     modern browser should work) automatically reconnects and asks for
     the status again every 5 seconds or so.  The URL would have to be
     composed so that it begins with "http://", followed by the _URI_
     the server is reachable from the client's point of view.

     Maybe you want also to visualize the countdown as a status bar by
     creating a '<table>' consisting of one row and 'n' columns whose
     fields contain small images of either a red or a green light.

5 Supporting basic authentication
*********************************

With the small exception of IP address based access control, requests
from all connecting clients where served equally until now.  This
chapter discusses a first method of client's authentication and its
limits.

   A very simple approach feasible with the means already discussed
would be to expect the password in the _URI_ string before granting
access to the secured areas.  The password could be separated from the
actual resource identifier by a certain character, thus the request line
might look like
GET /picture.png?mypassword

   In the rare situation where the client is customized enough and the
connection occurs through secured lines (e.g., a embedded device
directly attached to another via wire) and where the ability to embedd a
password in the URI or to pass on a URI with a password are desired,
this can be a reasonable choice.

   But when it is assumed that the user connecting does so with an
ordinary Internet browser, this implementation brings some problems
about.  For example, the URI including the password stays in the address
field or at least in the history of the browser for anybody near enough
to see.  It will also be inconvenient to add the password manually to
any new URI when the browser does not know how to compose this
automatically.

   At least the convenience issue can be addressed by employing the
simplest built-in password facilities of HTTP compliant browsers, hence
we want to start there.  It will however turn out to have still severe
weaknesses in terms of security which need consideration.

   Before we will start implementing _Basic Authentication_ as described
in _RFC 2617_, we should finally abandon the bad practice of responding
every request the first time our callback is called for a given
connection.  This is becoming more important now because the client and
the server will have to talk in a more bi-directional way than before to

   But how can we tell whether the callback has been called before for
the particular connection?  Initially, the pointer this parameter
references is set by _MHD_ in the callback.  But it will also be
"remembered" on the next call (for the same connection).  Thus, we will
generate no response until the parameter is non-null--implying the
callback was called before at least once.  We do not need to share
information between different calls of the callback, so we can set the
parameter to any adress that is assured to be not null.  The pointer to
the 'connection' structure will be pointing to a legal address, so we
take this.

   The first time 'answer_to_connection' is called, we will not even
look at the headers.

static int 
answer_to_connection (void *cls, struct MHD_Connection *connection,
                      const char *url, const char *method, const char *version, 
                      const char *upload_data, size_t *upload_data_size,
                      void **con_cls)
{
  if (0 != strcmp(method, "GET")) return MHD_NO;
  if (NULL == *con_cls) {*con_cls = connection; return MHD_YES;}

  ... 
  /* else respond accordingly */
  ...
}

   Note how we lop off the connection on the first condition (no "GET"
request), but return asking for more on the other one with 'MHD_YES'.
With this minor change, we can proceed to implement the actual
authentication process.

Request for authentication
==========================

Let us assume we had only files not intended to be handed out without
the correct username/password, so every "GET" request will be
challenged.  _RFC 2617_ describes how the server shall ask for
authentication by adding a _WWW-Authenticate_ response header with the
name of the _realm_ protected.  MHD can generate and queue such a
failure response for you using the 'MHD_queue_basic_auth_fail_response'
API. The only thing you need to do is construct a response with the
error page to be shown to the user if he aborts basic authentication.
But first, you should check if the proper credentials were already
supplied using the 'MHD_basic_auth_get_username_password' call.

   Your code would then look like this:
static int
answer_to_connection (void *cls, struct MHD_Connection *connection,
                      const char *url, const char *method,
                      const char *version, const char *upload_data,
                      size_t *upload_data_size, void **con_cls)
{
  char *user;
  char *pass;
  int fail;
  struct MHD_Response *response;

  if (0 != strcmp (method, MHD_HTTP_METHOD_GET))
    return MHD_NO;
  if (NULL == *con_cls)
    {
      *con_cls = connection;
      return MHD_YES;
    }
  pass = NULL;
  user = MHD_basic_auth_get_username_password (connection, &pass);
  fail = ( (user == NULL) ||
	   (0 != strcmp (user, "root")) ||
	   (0 != strcmp (pass, "pa$$w0rd") ) );  
  if (user != NULL) free (user);
  if (pass != NULL) free (pass);
  if (fail)
    {
      const char *page = "<html><body>Go away.</body></html>";
      response =
	MHD_create_response_from_buffer (strlen (page), (void *) page, 
				       MHD_RESPMEM_PERSISTENT);
      ret = MHD_queue_basic_auth_fail_response (connection,
						"my realm",
						response);
    }
  else
    {
      const char *page = "<html><body>A secret.</body></html>";
      response =
	MHD_create_response_from_buffer (strlen (page), (void *) page, 
				       MHD_RESPMEM_PERSISTENT);
      ret = MHD_queue_response (connection, MHD_HTTP_OK, response);
    }
  MHD_destroy_response (response);
  return ret;
}

   See the 'examples' directory for the complete example file.

Remarks
=======

For a proper server, the conditional statements leading to a return of
'MHD_NO' should yield a response with a more precise status code instead
of silently closing the connection.  For example, failures of memory
allocation are best reported as _internal server error_ and unexpected
authentication methods as _400 bad request_.

Exercises
=========

   * Make the server respond to wrong credentials (but otherwise
     well-formed requests) with the recommended _401 unauthorized_
     status code.  If the client still does not authenticate correctly
     within the same connection, close it and store the client's IP
     address for a certain time.  (It is OK to check for expiration not
     until the main thread wakes up again on the next connection.)  If
     the client fails authenticating three times during this period, add
     it to another list for which the 'AcceptPolicyCallback' function
     denies connection (temporally).

   * With the network utility 'netcat' connect and log the response of a
     "GET" request as you did in the exercise of the first example, this
     time to a file.  Now stop the server and let _netcat_ listen on the
     same port the server used to listen on and have it fake being the
     proper server by giving the file's content as the response (e.g.
     'cat log | nc -l -p 8888').  Pretending to think your were
     connecting to the actual server, browse to the eavesdropper and
     give the correct credentials.

     Copy and paste the encoded string you see in 'netcat''s output to
     some of the Base64 decode tools available online and see how both
     the user's name and password could be completely restored.

6 Processing POST data
**********************

The previous chapters already have demonstrated a variety of
possibilities to send information to the HTTP server, but it is not
recommended that the _GET_ method is used to alter the way the server
operates.  To induce changes on the server, the _POST_ method is
preferred over and is much more powerful than _GET_ and will be
introduced in this chapter.

   We are going to write an application that asks for the visitor's name
and, after the user has posted it, composes an individual response text.
Even though it was not mandatory to use the _POST_ method here, as there
is no permanent change caused by the POST, it is an illustrative example
on how to share data between different functions for the same
connection.  Furthermore, the reader should be able to extend it easily.

GET request
===========

When the first _GET_ request arrives, the server shall respond with a
HTML page containing an edit field for the name.

const char* askpage = "<html><body>\
                       What's your name, Sir?<br>\
                       <form action=\"/namepost\" method=\"post\">\
                       <input name=\"name\" type=\"text\"\
                       <input type=\"submit\" value=\" Send \"></form>\
                       </body></html>";

   The 'action' entry is the _URI_ to be called by the browser when
posting, and the 'name' will be used later to be sure it is the
editbox's content that has been posted.

   We also prepare the answer page, where the name is to be filled in
later, and an error page as the response for anything but proper _GET_
and _POST_ requests:

const char* greatingpage="<html><body><h1>Welcome, %s!</center></h1></body></html>";

const char* errorpage="<html><body>This doesn't seem to be right.</body></html>";

   Whenever we need to send a page, we use an extra function 'int
send_page(struct MHD_Connection *connection, const char* page)' for
this, which does not contain anything new and whose implementation is
therefore not discussed further in the tutorial.

POST request
============

Posted data can be of arbitrary and considerable size; for example, if a
user uploads a big image to the server.  Similar to the case of the
header fields, there may also be different streams of posted data, such
as one containing the text of an editbox and another the state of a
button.  Likewise, we will have to register an iterator function that is
going to be called maybe several times not only if there are different
POSTs but also if one POST has only been received partly yet and needs
processing before another chunk can be received.

   Such an iterator function is called by a _postprocessor_, which must
be created upon arriving of the post request.  We want the iterator
function to read the first post data which is tagged 'name' and to
create an individual greeting string based on the template and the name.
But in order to pass this string to other functions and still be able to
differentiate different connections, we must first define a structure to
share the information, holding the most import entries.

struct connection_info_struct
{
  int connectiontype;
  char *answerstring;
  struct MHD_PostProcessor *postprocessor; 
};

   With these information available to the iterator function, it is able
to fulfill its task.  Once it has composed the greeting string, it
returns 'MHD_NO' to inform the post processor that it does not need to
be called again.  Note that this function does not handle processing of
data for the same 'key'.  If we were to expect that the name will be
posted in several chunks, we had to expand the namestring dynamically as
additional parts of it with the same 'key' came in.  But in this
example, the name is assumed to fit entirely inside one single packet.

static int 
iterate_post (void *coninfo_cls, enum MHD_ValueKind kind, const char *key,
              const char *filename, const char *content_type,
              const char *transfer_encoding, const char *data, 
	      uint64_t off, size_t size)
{
  struct connection_info_struct *con_info = coninfo_cls;

  if (0 == strcmp (key, "name"))
    {
      if ((size > 0) && (size <= MAXNAMESIZE))
        {
          char *answerstring;
          answerstring = malloc (MAXANSWERSIZE);
          if (!answerstring) return MHD_NO;
      
          snprintf (answerstring, MAXANSWERSIZE, greatingpage, data);
          con_info->answerstring = answerstring;      
        } 
      else con_info->answerstring = NULL;

      return MHD_NO;
    }

  return MHD_YES;
}

   Once a connection has been established, it can be terminated for many
reasons.  As these reasons include unexpected events, we have to
register another function that cleans up any resources that might have
been allocated for that connection by us, namely the post processor and
the greetings string.  This cleanup function must take into account that
it will also be called for finished requests other than _POST_ requests.

void request_completed (void *cls, struct MHD_Connection *connection, 
     		        void **con_cls,
                        enum MHD_RequestTerminationCode toe)
{
  struct connection_info_struct *con_info = *con_cls;

  if (NULL == con_info) return;
  if (con_info->connectiontype == POST)
    {
      MHD_destroy_post_processor (con_info->postprocessor);        
      if (con_info->answerstring) free (con_info->answerstring);
    }
  
  free (con_info);
  *con_cls = NULL;   
}

   _GNU libmicrohttpd_ is informed that it shall call the above function
when the daemon is started in the main function.

...
daemon = MHD_start_daemon (MHD_USE_INTERNAL_POLLING_THREAD, PORT, NULL, NULL,
                           &answer_to_connection, NULL, 
			   MHD_OPTION_NOTIFY_COMPLETED, &request_completed, NULL,
			   MHD_OPTION_END);
...

Request handling
================

With all other functions prepared, we can now discuss the actual request
handling.

   On the first iteration for a new request, we start by allocating a
new instance of a 'struct connection_info_struct' structure, which will
store all necessary information for later iterations and other
functions.

static int 
answer_to_connection (void *cls, struct MHD_Connection *connection, 
		      const char *url, 
                      const char *method, const char *version, 
		      const char *upload_data, 
                      size_t *upload_data_size, void **con_cls)
{
  if(NULL == *con_cls) 
    {
      struct connection_info_struct *con_info;

      con_info = malloc (sizeof (struct connection_info_struct));
      if (NULL == con_info) return MHD_NO;
      con_info->answerstring = NULL;

   If the new request is a _POST_, the postprocessor must be created
now.  In addition, the type of the request is stored for convenience.
      if (0 == strcmp (method, "POST")) 
        {      
          con_info->postprocessor 
	    = MHD_create_post_processor (connection, POSTBUFFERSIZE, 
                                         iterate_post, (void*) con_info);   

          if (NULL == con_info->postprocessor) 
            {
              free (con_info); 
              return MHD_NO;
            }
          con_info->connectiontype = POST;
        } 
      else con_info->connectiontype = GET;

   The address of our structure will both serve as the indicator for
successive iterations and to remember the particular details about the
connection.
      *con_cls = (void*) con_info; 
      return MHD_YES;
    }

   The rest of the function will not be executed on the first iteration.
A _GET_ request is easily satisfied by sending the question form.
  if (0 == strcmp (method, "GET")) 
    {
      return send_page (connection, askpage);     
    } 

   In case of _POST_, we invoke the post processor for as long as data
keeps incoming, setting '*upload_data_size' to zero in order to indicate
that we have processed--or at least have considered--all of it.
  if (0 == strcmp (method, "POST")) 
    {
      struct connection_info_struct *con_info = *con_cls;

      if (*upload_data_size != 0) 
        {
          MHD_post_process (con_info->postprocessor, upload_data,	
	                    *upload_data_size);
          *upload_data_size = 0;
          
          return MHD_YES;
        } 
      else if (NULL != con_info->answerstring) 
        return send_page (connection, con_info->answerstring);
    } 

   Finally, if they are neither _GET_ nor _POST_ requests, the error
page is returned.
  return send_page(connection, errorpage); 
}

   These were the important parts of the program 'simplepost.c'.

7 Improved processing of POST data
**********************************

The previous chapter introduced a way to upload data to the server, but
the developed example program has some shortcomings, such as not being
able to handle larger chunks of data.  In this chapter, we are going to
discuss a more advanced server program that allows clients to upload a
file in order to have it stored on the server's filesystem.  The server
shall also watch and limit the number of clients concurrently uploading,
responding with a proper busy message if necessary.

Prepared answers
================

We choose to operate the server with the 'SELECT_INTERNALLY' method.
This makes it easier to synchronize the global states at the cost of
possible delays for other connections if the processing of a request is
too slow.  One of these variables that needs to be shared for all
connections is the total number of clients that are uploading.

#define MAXCLIENTS      2
static unsigned int    nr_of_uploading_clients = 0;

   If there are too many clients uploading, we want the server to
respond to all requests with a busy message.
const char* busypage = 
  "<html><body>This server is busy, please try again later.</body></html>";

   Otherwise, the server will send a _form_ that informs the user of the
current number of uploading clients, and ask her to pick a file on her
local filesystem which is to be uploaded.
const char* askpage = "<html><body>\n\
                       Upload a file, please!<br>\n\
                       There are %u clients uploading at the moment.<br>\n\
                       <form action=\"/filepost\" method=\"post\" \
                         enctype=\"multipart/form-data\">\n\
                       <input name=\"file\" type=\"file\">\n\
                       <input type=\"submit\" value=\" Send \"></form>\n\
                       </body></html>";

   If the upload has succeeded, the server will respond with a message
saying so.
const char* completepage = "<html><body>The upload has been completed.</body></html>";

   We want the server to report internal errors, such as memory shortage
or file access problems, adequately.
const char* servererrorpage 
  = "<html><body>An internal server error has occured.</body></html>";
const char* fileexistspage
  = "<html><body>This file already exists.</body></html>";

   It would be tolerable to send all these responses undifferentiated
with a '200 HTTP_OK' status code but in order to improve the 'HTTP'
conformance of our server a bit, we extend the 'send_page' function so
that it accepts individual status codes.

static int 
send_page (struct MHD_Connection *connection, 
	   const char* page, int status_code)
{
  int ret;
  struct MHD_Response *response;
  
  response = MHD_create_response_from_buffer (strlen (page), (void*) page, 
  	     				      MHD_RESPMEM_MUST_COPY);
  if (!response) return MHD_NO;
 
  ret = MHD_queue_response (connection, status_code, response);
  MHD_destroy_response (response);

  return ret;
}

   Note how we ask _MHD_ to make its own copy of the message data.  The
reason behind this will become clear later.

Connection cycle
================

The decision whether the server is busy or not is made right at the
beginning of the connection.  To do that at this stage is especially
important for _POST_ requests because if no response is queued at this
point, and 'MHD_YES' returned, _MHD_ will not sent any queued messages
until a postprocessor has been created and the post iterator is called
at least once.

static int 
answer_to_connection (void *cls, struct MHD_Connection *connection, 
		      const char *url, 
                      const char *method, const char *version, 
		      const char *upload_data, 
                      size_t *upload_data_size, void **con_cls)
{
  if (NULL == *con_cls) 
    {
      struct connection_info_struct *con_info;

      if (nr_of_uploading_clients >= MAXCLIENTS) 
        return send_page(connection, busypage, MHD_HTTP_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE);

   If the server is not busy, the 'connection_info' structure is
initialized as usual, with the addition of a filepointer for each
connection.

      con_info = malloc (sizeof (struct connection_info_struct));
      if (NULL == con_info) return MHD_NO;
      con_info->fp = 0;

      if (0 == strcmp (method, "POST")) 
        {  
          ...
        } 
      else con_info->connectiontype = GET;

      *con_cls = (void*) con_info;
 
      return MHD_YES;
    }

   For _POST_ requests, the postprocessor is created and we register a
new uploading client.  From this point on, there are many possible
places for errors to occur that make it necessary to interrupt the
uploading process.  We need a means of having the proper response
message ready at all times.  Therefore, the 'connection_info' structure
is extended to hold the most current response message so that whenever a
response is sent, the client will get the most informative message.
Here, the structure is initialized to "no error".
      if (0 == strcmp (method, "POST")) 
        {  
          con_info->postprocessor 
	    = MHD_create_post_processor (connection, POSTBUFFERSIZE, 
                                         iterate_post, (void*) con_info);   

          if (NULL == con_info->postprocessor) 
            {
              free (con_info); 
              return MHD_NO;
            }

          nr_of_uploading_clients++;
          
          con_info->connectiontype = POST;
          con_info->answercode = MHD_HTTP_OK;
          con_info->answerstring = completepage;
        } 
      else con_info->connectiontype = GET;

   If the connection handler is called for the second time, _GET_
requests will be answered with the _form_.  We can keep the buffer under
function scope, because we asked _MHD_ to make its own copy of it for as
long as it is needed.
  if (0 == strcmp (method, "GET")) 
    {
      int ret;
      char buffer[1024];
        
      sprintf (buffer, askpage, nr_of_uploading_clients);
      return send_page (connection, buffer, MHD_HTTP_OK);     
    } 

   The rest of the 'answer_to_connection' function is very similar to
the 'simplepost.c' example, except the more flexible content of the
responses.  The _POST_ data is processed until there is none left and
the execution falls through to return an error page if the connection
constituted no expected request method.
  if (0 == strcmp (method, "POST")) 
    {
      struct connection_info_struct *con_info = *con_cls;
       
      if (0 != *upload_data_size) 
        { 
          MHD_post_process (con_info->postprocessor,
	                    upload_data, *upload_data_size);
          *upload_data_size = 0;
          
          return MHD_YES;
        } 
      else 
        return send_page (connection, con_info->answerstring, 
	       		  con_info->answercode);
    } 

  return send_page(connection, errorpage, MHD_HTTP_BAD_REQUEST);
}

Storing to data
===============

Unlike the 'simplepost.c' example, here it is to be expected that post
iterator will be called several times now.  This means that for any
given connection (there might be several concurrent of them) the posted
data has to be written to the correct file.  That is why we store a file
handle in every 'connection_info', so that the it is preserved between
successive iterations.
static int 
iterate_post (void *coninfo_cls, enum MHD_ValueKind kind, 
	      const char *key,
	      const char *filename, const char *content_type,
              const char *transfer_encoding, const char *data, 
	      uint64_t off, size_t size)
{
  struct connection_info_struct *con_info = coninfo_cls;

   Because the following actions depend heavily on correct file
processing, which might be error prone, we default to reporting internal
errors in case anything will go wrong.

con_info->answerstring = servererrorpage;
con_info->answercode = MHD_HTTP_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR;

   In the "askpage" _form_, we told the client to label its post data
with the "file" key.  Anything else would be an error.

  if (0 != strcmp (key, "file")) return MHD_NO;

   If the iterator is called for the first time, no file will have been
opened yet.  The 'filename' string contains the name of the file
(without any paths) the user selected on his system.  We want to take
this as the name the file will be stored on the server and make sure no
file of that name exists (or is being uploaded) before we create one
(note that the code below technically contains a race between the two
"fopen" calls, but we will overlook this for portability sake).
  if (!con_info->fp)
    {
      if (NULL != (fp = fopen (filename, "rb")) )
        {
          fclose (fp);
          con_info->answerstring = fileexistspage;
          con_info->answercode = MHD_HTTP_FORBIDDEN;
          return MHD_NO;
        }
      
      con_info->fp = fopen (filename, "ab");
      if (!con_info->fp) return MHD_NO;    
    }

   Occasionally, the iterator function will be called even when there
are 0 new bytes to process.  The server only needs to write data to the
file if there is some.
if (size > 0) 
    {  
      if (!fwrite (data, size, sizeof(char), con_info->fp))
        return MHD_NO;
    }

   If this point has been reached, everything worked well for this
iteration and the response can be set to success again.  If the upload
has finished, this iterator function will not be called again.
  con_info->answerstring = completepage;
  con_info->answercode = MHD_HTTP_OK;

  return MHD_YES;
}

   The new client was registered when the postprocessor was created.
Likewise, we unregister the client on destroying the postprocessor when
the request is completed.
void request_completed (void *cls, struct MHD_Connection *connection, 
     		        void **con_cls,
                        enum MHD_RequestTerminationCode toe)
{
  struct connection_info_struct *con_info = *con_cls;

  if (NULL == con_info) return;

  if (con_info->connectiontype == POST)
    {
      if (NULL != con_info->postprocessor) 
        {
          MHD_destroy_post_processor (con_info->postprocessor); 
          nr_of_uploading_clients--;
        }

      if (con_info->fp) fclose (con_info->fp); 
    }

  free (con_info);
  *con_cls = NULL;      
}

   This is essentially the whole example 'largepost.c'.

Remarks
=======

Now that the clients are able to create files on the server, security
aspects are becoming even more important than before.  Aside from proper
client authentication, the server should always make sure explicitly
that no files will be created outside of a dedicated upload directory.
In particular, filenames must be checked to not contain strings like
"../".

8 Session management
********************

This chapter discusses how one should manage sessions, that is, share
state between multiple HTTP requests from the same user.  We use a
simple example where the user submits multiple forms and the server is
supposed to accumulate state from all of these forms.  Naturally, as
this is a network protocol, our session mechanism must support having
many users with many concurrent sessions at the same time.

   In order to track users, we use a simple session cookie.  A session
cookie expires when the user closes the browser.  Changing from session
cookies to persistent cookies only requires adding an expiration time to
the cookie.  The server creates a fresh session cookie whenever a
request without a cookie is received, or if the supplied session cookie
is not known to the server.

Looking up the cookie
=====================

Since MHD parses the HTTP cookie header for us, looking up an existing
cookie is straightforward:

const char *value;

value = MHD_lookup_connection_value (connection,
                                     MHD_COOKIE_KIND,
                                     "KEY");

   Here, "KEY" is the name we chose for our session cookie.

Setting the cookie header
=========================

MHD requires the user to provide the full cookie format string in order
to set cookies.  In order to generate a unique cookie, our example
creates a random 64-character text string to be used as the value of the
cookie:

char value[128];
char raw_value[65];

for (unsigned int i=0;i<sizeof (raw_value);i++)
  raw_value = 'A' + (rand () % 26); /* bad PRNG! */
raw_value[64] = '\0';
snprintf (value, sizeof (value),
          "%s=%s",
          "KEY",
          raw_value);

   Given this cookie value, we can then set the cookie header in our
HTTP response as follows:

assert (MHD_YES ==
        MHD_set_connection_value (connection,
                                  MHD_HEADER_KIND,
                                  MHD_HTTP_HEADER_SET_COOKIE,
                                  value));

Remark: Session expiration
==========================

It is of course possible that clients stop their interaction with the
server at any time.  In order to avoid using too much storage, the
server must thus discard inactive sessions at some point.  Our example
implements this by discarding inactive sessions after a certain amount
of time.  Alternatively, the implementation may limit the total number
of active sessions.  Which bounds are used for idle sessions or the
total number of sessions obviously depends largely on the type of the
application and available server resources.

Example code
============

A sample application implementing a website with multiple forms (which
are dynamically created using values from previous POST requests from
the same session) is available as the example 'sessions.c'.

   Note that the example uses a simple, $O(n)$ linked list traversal to
look up sessions and to expire old sessions.  Using a hash table and a
heap would be more appropriate if a large number of concurrent sessions
is expected.

Remarks
=======

Naturally, it is quite conceivable to store session data in a database
instead of in memory.  Still, having mechanisms to expire data
associated with long-time idle sessions (where the business process has
still not finished) is likely a good idea.

9 Adding a layer of security
****************************

We left the basic authentication chapter with the unsatisfactory
conclusion that any traffic, including the credentials, could be
intercepted by anyone between the browser client and the server.
Protecting the data while it is sent over unsecured lines will be the
goal of this chapter.

   Since version 0.4, the _MHD_ library includes support for encrypting
the traffic by employing SSL/TSL. If _GNU libmicrohttpd_ has been
configured to support these, encryption and decryption can be applied
transparently on the data being sent, with only minimal changes to the
actual source code of the example.

Preparation
===========

First, a private key for the server will be generated.  With this key,
the server will later be able to authenticate itself to the
client--preventing anyone else from stealing the password by faking its
identity.  The _OpenSSL_ suite, which is available on many operating
systems, can generate such a key.  For the scope of this tutorial, we
will be content with a 1024 bit key:
> openssl genrsa -out server.key 1024

   In addition to the key, a certificate describing the server in human
readable tokens is also needed.  This certificate will be attested with
our aforementioned key.  In this way, we obtain a self-signed
certificate, valid for one year.

> openssl req -days 365 -out server.pem -new -x509 -key server.key

   To avoid unnecessary error messages in the browser, the certificate
needs to have a name that matches the _URI_, for example, "localhost" or
the domain.  If you plan to have a publicly reachable server, you will
need to ask a trusted third party, called _Certificate Authority_, or
_CA_, to attest the certificate for you.  This way, any visitor can make
sure the server's identity is real.

   Whether the server's certificate is signed by us or a third party,
once it has been accepted by the client, both sides will be
communicating over encrypted channels.  From this point on, it is the
client's turn to authenticate itself.  But this has already been
implemented in the basic authentication scheme.

Changing the source code
========================

We merely have to extend the server program so that it loads the two
files into memory,

int
main ()
{
  struct MHD_Daemon *daemon;
  char *key_pem;
  char *cert_pem;

  key_pem = load_file (SERVERKEYFILE);
  cert_pem = load_file (SERVERCERTFILE);

  if ((key_pem == NULL) || (cert_pem == NULL))
  {
    printf ("The key/certificate files could not be read.\n");
    return 1;
  }

   and then we point the _MHD_ daemon to it upon initalization.

  daemon = MHD_start_daemon (MHD_USE_INTERNAL_POLLING_THREAD | MHD_USE_SSL,
  	   		     PORT, NULL, NULL,
                             &answer_to_connection, NULL,
                             MHD_OPTION_HTTPS_MEM_KEY, key_pem,
                             MHD_OPTION_HTTPS_MEM_CERT, cert_pem,
                             MHD_OPTION_END);

  if (NULL == daemon)
    {
      printf ("%s\n", cert_pem);

      free (key_pem);
      free (cert_pem);

      return 1;
    }

   The rest consists of little new besides some additional memory
cleanups.

  getchar ();

  MHD_stop_daemon (daemon);
  free (key_pem);
  free (cert_pem);

  return 0;
}

   The rather unexciting file loader can be found in the complete
example 'tlsauthentication.c'.

Remarks
=======

   * While the standard _HTTP_ port is 80, it is 443 for _HTTPS_. The
     common internet browsers assume standard _HTTP_ if they are asked
     to access other ports than these.  Therefore, you will have to type
     'https://localhost:8888' explicitly when you test the example, or
     the browser will not know how to handle the answer properly.

   * The remaining weak point is the question how the server will be
     trusted initially.  Either a _CA_ signs the certificate or the
     client obtains the key over secure means.  Anyway, the clients have
     to be aware (or configured) that they should not accept
     certificates of unknown origin.

   * The introduced method of certificates makes it mandatory to set an
     expiration date--making it less feasible to hardcode certificates
     in embedded devices.

   * The cryptographic facilities consume memory space and computing
     time.  For this reason, websites usually consists both of
     uncritically _HTTP_ parts and secured _HTTPS_.

Client authentication
=====================

You can also use MHD to authenticate the client via SSL/TLS certificates
(as an alternative to using the password-based Basic or Digest
authentication).  To do this, you will need to link your application
against _gnutls_.  Next, when you start the MHD daemon, you must specify
the root CA that you're willing to trust:
  daemon = MHD_start_daemon (MHD_USE_INTERNAL_POLLING_THREAD | MHD_USE_SSL,
  	   		     PORT, NULL, NULL,
                             &answer_to_connection, NULL,
                             MHD_OPTION_HTTPS_MEM_KEY, key_pem,
                             MHD_OPTION_HTTPS_MEM_CERT, cert_pem,
			     MHD_OPTION_HTTPS_MEM_TRUST, root_ca_pem,
                             MHD_OPTION_END);

   With this, you can then obtain client certificates for each session.
In order to obtain the identity of the client, you first need to obtain
the raw GnuTLS session handle from _MHD_ using
'MHD_get_connection_info'.

#include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
#include <gnutls/x509.h>

gnutls_session_t tls_session;
union MHD_ConnectionInfo *ci;

ci = MHD_get_connection_info (connection,
                              MHD_CONNECTION_INFO_GNUTLS_SESSION);
tls_session = ci->tls_session;

   You can then extract the client certificate:

/**
 * Get the client's certificate
 *
 * @param tls_session the TLS session
 * @return NULL if no valid client certificate could be found, a pointer
 *  	to the certificate if found
 */
static gnutls_x509_crt_t
get_client_certificate (gnutls_session_t tls_session)
{
  unsigned int listsize;
  const gnutls_datum_t * pcert;
  gnutls_certificate_status_t client_cert_status;
  gnutls_x509_crt_t client_cert;

  if (tls_session == NULL)
    return NULL;
  if (gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2(tls_session,
				       &client_cert_status))
    return NULL;
  pcert = gnutls_certificate_get_peers(tls_session,
				       &listsize);
  if ( (pcert == NULL) ||
       (listsize == 0))
    {
      fprintf (stderr,
	       "Failed to retrieve client certificate chain\n");
      return NULL;
    }
  if (gnutls_x509_crt_init(&client_cert))
    {
      fprintf (stderr,
	       "Failed to initialize client certificate\n");
      return NULL;
    }
  /* Note that by passing values between 0 and listsize here, you
     can get access to the CA's certs */
  if (gnutls_x509_crt_import(client_cert,
			     &pcert[0],
			     GNUTLS_X509_FMT_DER))
    {
      fprintf (stderr,
	       "Failed to import client certificate\n");
      gnutls_x509_crt_deinit(client_cert);
      return NULL;
    }
  return client_cert;
}

   Using the client certificate, you can then get the client's
distinguished name and alternative names:

/**
 * Get the distinguished name from the client's certificate
 *
 * @param client_cert the client certificate
 * @return NULL if no dn or certificate could be found, a pointer
 * 			to the dn if found
 */
char *
cert_auth_get_dn(gnutls_x509_crt_c client_cert)
{
  char* buf;
  size_t lbuf;

  lbuf = 0;
  gnutls_x509_crt_get_dn(client_cert, NULL, &lbuf);
  buf = malloc(lbuf);
  if (buf == NULL)
    {
      fprintf (stderr,
	       "Failed to allocate memory for certificate dn\n");
      return NULL;
    }
  gnutls_x509_crt_get_dn(client_cert, buf, &lbuf);
  return buf;
}


/**
 * Get the alternative name of specified type from the client's certificate
 *
 * @param client_cert the client certificate
 * @param nametype The requested name type
 * @param index The position of the alternative name if multiple names are
 * 			matching the requested type, 0 for the first matching name
 * @return NULL if no matching alternative name could be found, a pointer
 * 			to the alternative name if found
 */
char *
MHD_cert_auth_get_alt_name(gnutls_x509_crt_t client_cert,
			   int nametype,
			   unsigned int index)
{
  char* buf;
  size_t lbuf;
  unsigned int seq;
  unsigned int subseq;
  unsigned int type;
  int result;

  subseq = 0;
  for (seq=0;;seq++)
    {
      lbuf = 0;
      result = gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject_alt_name2(client_cert, seq, NULL, &lbuf,
						     &type, NULL);
      if (result == GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE)
	return NULL;
      if (nametype != (int) type)
	continue;
      if (subseq == index)
	break;
      subseq++;
    }
  buf = malloc(lbuf);
  if (buf == NULL)
    {
      fprintf (stderr,
	       "Failed to allocate memory for certificate alt name\n");
      return NULL;
    }
  result = gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject_alt_name2(client_cert,
						 seq,
						 buf,
						 &lbuf,
						 NULL, NULL);
  if (result != nametype)
    {
      fprintf (stderr,
	       "Unexpected return value from gnutls: %d\n",
	       result);
      free (buf);
      return NULL;
    }
  return buf;
}

   Finally, you should release the memory associated with the client
certificate:

gnutls_x509_crt_deinit (client_cert);

Using TLS Server Name Indication (SNI)
======================================

SNI enables hosting multiple domains under one IP address with TLS. So
SNI is the TLS-equivalent of virtual hosting.  To use SNI with MHD, you
need at least GnuTLS 3.0.  The main change compared to the simple
hosting of one domain is that you need to provide a callback instead of
the key and certificate.  For example, when you start the MHD daemon,
you could do this:
  daemon = MHD_start_daemon (MHD_USE_INTERNAL_POLLING_THREAD | MHD_USE_SSL,
  	   		     PORT, NULL, NULL,
                             &answer_to_connection, NULL,
                             MHD_OPTION_HTTPS_CERT_CALLBACK, &sni_callback,
                             MHD_OPTION_END);
   Here, 'sni_callback' is the name of a function that you will have to
implement to retrieve the X.509 certificate for an incoming connection.
The callback has type 'gnutls_certificate_retrieve_function2' and is
documented in the GnuTLS API for the
'gnutls_certificate_set_retrieve_function2' as follows:

 -- Function Pointer: int *gnutls_certificate_retrieve_function2
          (gnutls_session_t, const gnutls_datum_t* req_ca_dn, int nreqs,
          const gnutls_pk_algorithm_t* pk_algos, int pk_algos_length,
          gnutls_pcert_st** pcert, unsigned int *pcert_length,
          gnutls_privkey_t * pkey)

     REQ_CA_CERT
          is only used in X.509 certificates.  Contains a list with the
          CA names that the server considers trusted.  Normally we
          should send a certificate that is signed by one of these CAs.
          These names are DER encoded.  To get a more meaningful value
          use the function 'gnutls_x509_rdn_get()'.

     PK_ALGOS
          contains a list with server’s acceptable signature
          algorithms.  The certificate returned should support the
          server’s given algorithms.

     PCERT
          should contain a single certificate and public or a list of
          them.

     PCERT_LENGTH
          is the size of the previous list.

     PKEY
          is the private key.

   A possible implementation of this callback would look like this:

struct Hosts
{
  struct Hosts *next;
  const char *hostname;
  gnutls_pcert_st pcrt;
  gnutls_privkey_t key;
};

static struct Hosts *hosts;

int
sni_callback (gnutls_session_t session,
              const gnutls_datum_t* req_ca_dn,
              int nreqs,
              const gnutls_pk_algorithm_t* pk_algos,
              int pk_algos_length,
              gnutls_pcert_st** pcert,
              unsigned int *pcert_length,
              gnutls_privkey_t * pkey)
{
  char name[256];
  size_t name_len;
  struct Hosts *host;
  unsigned int type;

  name_len = sizeof (name);
  if (GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS !=
      gnutls_server_name_get (session,
                              name,
                              &name_len,
                              &type,
                              0 /* index */))
    return -1;
  for (host = hosts; NULL != host; host = host->next)
    if (0 == strncmp (name, host->hostname, name_len))
      break;
  if (NULL == host)
    {
      fprintf (stderr,
               "Need certificate for %.*s\n",
               (int) name_len,
               name);
      return -1;
    }
  fprintf (stderr,
           "Returning certificate for %.*s\n",
           (int) name_len,
           name);
  *pkey = host->key;
  *pcert_length = 1;
  *pcert = &host->pcrt;
  return 0;
}

   Note that MHD cannot offer passing a closure or any other additional
information to this callback, as the GnuTLS API unfortunately does not
permit this at this point.

   The 'hosts' list can be initialized by loading the private keys and
X.509 certificats from disk as follows:

static void
load_keys(const char *hostname,
          const char *CERT_FILE,
          const char *KEY_FILE)
{
  int ret;
  gnutls_datum_t data;
  struct Hosts *host;

  host = malloc (sizeof (struct Hosts));
  host->hostname = hostname;
  host->next = hosts;
  hosts = host;

  ret = gnutls_load_file (CERT_FILE, &data);
  if (ret < 0)
  {
    fprintf (stderr,
             "*** Error loading certificate file %s.\n",
             CERT_FILE);
    exit(1);
  }
  ret =
    gnutls_pcert_import_x509_raw (&host->pcrt, &data, GNUTLS_X509_FMT_PEM,
                                  0);
  if (ret < 0)
  {
    fprintf(stderr,
            "*** Error loading certificate file: %s\n",
            gnutls_strerror (ret));
    exit(1);
  }
  gnutls_free (data.data);

  ret = gnutls_load_file (KEY_FILE, &data);
  if (ret < 0)
  {
    fprintf (stderr,
             "*** Error loading key file %s.\n",
             KEY_FILE);
    exit(1);
  }

  gnutls_privkey_init (&host->key);
  ret =
    gnutls_privkey_import_x509_raw (host->key,
                                    &data, GNUTLS_X509_FMT_PEM,
                                    NULL, 0);
  if (ret < 0)
  {
    fprintf (stderr,
             "*** Error loading key file: %s\n",
             gnutls_strerror (ret));
    exit(1);
  }
  gnutls_free (data.data);
}

   The code above was largely lifted from GnuTLS. You can find other
methods for initializing certificates and keys in the GnuTLS manual and
source code.

Appendix B GNU Free Documentation License
*****************************************

                     Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

     Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <http://fsf.org/>

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts."  line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.
