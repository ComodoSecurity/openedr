Q: Is there any way I can get the signed driver?

A: Each developer must sign the driver with own code signing certificate.

Q: How to sign the driver for using it on 64-bit Windows?

A: The drivers must be signed by two certificates:

- Code signing certificate from one of the supported authorities:
http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/winlogo/drvsign/crosscert.mspx

- Cross-certificate from Microsoft, which can be downloaded from the
same page.

-  signtool.exe  utility  must  be used with /ac option specifying the
appropriate  cross-certificate. The utility is included in Windows SDK and
WDK.

The  latest version of Windows 10 requires signing with EV certificate
using Microsoft Dev Portal:
https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/windows_hardware_certification/2016/07/26/driver-signing-changes-in-windows-10-version-1607/

So to make WFP driver work on a clean installation of Windows 10 build
1607 it is necessary to get a EV code signing certificate, register on
Dev Portal, prepare .cab archive with the driver and some inf file and
sign the driver on the portal.

For  previous  versions  of  Windows  it  is  possible  to use the old
approach,  signing  the driver with signtool and cross-certificate. It
is   easier,   because  the binaries signed via Dev Portal work only on
Windows 10, and don't work on Windows 7/8 without HLK test:

Q: Unable to link with the static build of nfapi.lib, the linker shows "unresolved external symbol" errors.

A: Define a symbol _NFAPI_STATIC_LIB in project configuration or insert the following string before including nfapi.h:
#define _NFAPI_STATIC_LIB 1

Q: Unable to programmatically install the driver from 32-bit process on Vista\7 x64. 
The driver is always saved to windows\SysWOW64\drivers instead of windows\system32\drivers and can't start.

A: This is a feature of 64-bit Windows called "virtualization".
It  is  applied  to 32-bit applications. Windows redirects file system
and  registry  calls to different locations, used as an alternate view
of the standard folders and registry keys:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa384249%28VS.85%29.aspx

The following ways can be used to install the driver properly on x64:

- Call API function Wow64DisableWow64FsRedirection from 32-bit
installer before saving the driver to windows\system32\drivers:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa365743(VS.85).aspx
It is possible to do this using System plug-in in NSIS, and using
direct API call in other installers.

-  Use  64-bit  installer  on x64. For example Windows Installer (MSI)
allows to avoid all compatibility problems.
