- Added a flag FF_SSL_INDICATE_EXCEPTIONS for FT_SSL filter. When it is specified, SSL filter indicates the objects with type OT_SSL_EXCEPTION via dataPartAvailable each time when server or client closes a connection during SSL handshake. 
The indicated objects with type OT_SSL_EXCEPTION have one stream, containing a remote host name from TLS SNI field, or remote endpoint string host:port in case if SNI field is empty.
dataPartAvailable can return DPCR_BLOCK to avoid adding the host to list of exceptions.

- SSL filter tries to use TLS 1.2 protocol if the server doesn't support TLS 1.0.
